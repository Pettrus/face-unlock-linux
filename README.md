Go face unlock is a script created to provide similar functionality as Windows Hello but without a IR emitters to validate you using facial recognition on linux machines.

It uses [PAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM)(Pluggable Authentication Modules) so it works on login screen, sudo and su on the terminal.

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Pettrus/go-face-unlock.git
cd go-face-unlock
sudo ./main install
```

The script will take a picture of you to use as base for the facial recognition, so stand still and be on a well lit room for this first photo.

After installation everything should be working, open a new terminal and type some sudo command to see it working.

### Add new pictures

You can add more pictures to improve the recognition, for that use the command:
```
sudo ./main add
```

### Uninstall

```
sudo ./main uninstall
```

### Security

This script is by no mean a secure way to unlock your computer, just a convenient way to do it, if someone looks limilar to you or just a printed photo of you could fool the script.
